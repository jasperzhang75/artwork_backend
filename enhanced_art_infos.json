    "description": "<p>In his best-known and largest painting, Georges Seurat depicted people from different social classes strolling and relaxing in a park just west of Paris on La Grande Jatte, an island in the Seine River. Although he took his subject from modern life, Seurat sought to evoke the sense of timelessness associated with ancient art, especially Egyptian and Greek sculpture. He once wrote, “I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color.”</p>\n<p>Seurat painted <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em> using pointillism, a highly systematic and scientific technique based on the hypothesis that closely positioned points of pure color mix together in the viewer’s eye. He began work on the canvas in 1884 (and included this date in the title) with a layer of small, horizontal brushstrokes in complementary colors. He next added a series of dots that coalesce into solid and luminous forms when seen from a distance. Sometime before 1889 Seurat added a border of blue, orange, and red dots that provide a visual transition between the painting’s interior and the specially designed white frame, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/articles/969/la-grande-jatte-frame-by-frame\">which has been re-created at the Art Institute</a>.</p>\n",
    "short_description": "For his largest and best-known painting, Georges Seurat depicted Parisians enjoying all sorts of leisurely activities—strolling, lounging, sailing, and fishing—in the park called La Grande Jatte on the River Seine. He used an innovative technique called Pointillism that was inspired by optical and color theory, applying tiny dabs of different colored paint that viewers would see as a single, and Seurat believed, more brilliant hue.",

    "description": "<p>In 1878 the painter George Inness wrote in <em>Harper’s</em> magazine:</p>\n<p>&quot;Details in the pictures must be elaborated only enough fully to reproduce the impression that the artist wishes to reproduce. When [there are more details], the impression is weakened or lost, and we see simply an array of external things which may be cleverly painted and may look very real, but which do not make an artistic painting. . . . The one is poetic truth, the other is scientific truth; the former is aesthetic, the latter is analytic.&quot;</p>\n<p>In the course of his lengthy career, Inness increasingly eschewed precision of detail in his paintings, conveying mood and emotion through richness of tone and broadness of handling. He first visited Florida about 1890, and he subsequently established a house and studio in Tarpon Springs, where he executed this painting. In a pink-and-blue morning light, a lone man studies a cluster of buildings in the middle distance. Through blurred outlines and delicate, subtle tonalities, as well as the solitary presence of the figure, Inness masterfully evoked the brightening day and peaceful mood of this moment.</p>\n",

Mancini combines his interest in the French avant-garde with the rich palettes and dark tonal contrasts of Italian Baroque painting, applying his oils with ecstatic and reckless abandon.",

He also revisited an Impressionist subject that his colleagues had all but abandoned by the 1890s—the modern city. This bustling scene, alive with the noise and movement of traffic and pedestrians, was the view from his window at the Hôtel Garnier in Paris, where he stayed for a few weeks early in 1893. The building at the left edge of the canvas is the Gare Saint-Lazare.</p>\n",

For this image, Van Gogh copied a wood engraving from <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40517\">Honoré Daumier’s</a> <em>Drinkers</em>, a parody on the four ages of man. The exaggerated figure types capture Daumier’s characteristic humor and convey his sad message about the horrors of alcoholism. The greenish palette may well be an allusion to the notorious alcoholic drink absinthe.</p>\n",

In his vibrant take on Honoré Daumier’s woodcarving \"Physiology of Drinking,\" there is real pathos and a desperation in the earnest concentration with which the men drink, as if to quench a spiritual thirst.",

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Norwegian-born artist Jonas Lie received great acclaim for his luminous renderings of New York City. His unique merging of Impressionism with a bold, painterly realism was admired for its potency and vigor, which was seen as a healthy antidote to the more delicate styles of many American Impressionists. <em>Afterglow</em> also intrigued contemporary critics for its depiction of the city. Many reviewers questioned whether Lie's gleaming view of lower Manhattan—especially the monumental buildings of the financial district—was intended as an allegory or as a commentary on American economic power and aspirations. In these readings, the glowing buildings suggest a wondrous city of gold, yet one that remains tantalizingly in the distance.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In 1886 Vincent van Gogh left his native Holland and settled in Paris, where his beloved brother Theo was a dealer in paintings. Van Gogh created at least twenty-four self-portraits during his two-year stay in the energetic French capital. This early example is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist’s board rather than canvas. Its densely dabbed brushwork, which became a hallmark of Van Gogh’s style, reﬂects the artist’s response to Georges Seurat’s revolutionary pointillist technique in <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>. But what was for Seurat a method based on the cool objectivity of science became in Van Gogh’s hands an intense emotional language. The surface of the painting dances with particles of color—intense greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Dominating this dazzling array of staccato dots and dashes are the artist’s deep green eyes and the intensity of their gaze. “I prefer painting people’s eyes to cathedrals,” Van Gogh once wrote to Theo. “However solemn and imposing the latter may be—a human soul, be it that of a poor streetwalker, is more interesting to me.” From Paris, Van Gogh traveled to the southern town of Arles for fifteen months. At the time of his death, in 1890, he had actively pursued his art for only five years.</p>\n",
    "short_description": "Van Gogh’s face is as well known as his art—in fact, it is inseparable from it. The artist painted more than 35 self-portraits over his lifetime. This one was created in Paris under the influence of Seurat and pointillism. The intense dabs of paint and color, anchored by his eyes, create a turbulent energy, giving the viewer a deep sense of the artist’s presence.",

    "description": "<p>Claude Monet’s trip to Norway in 1895 was perhaps the most physically taxing of all his many painting campaigns. Touring the country with his stepson Jacques Hoschedé, who lived in Christiania (now Oslo), he was awestruck but initially frustrated in his search for good motifs amid the snow. Nevertheless, he painted 29 Norwegian scenes during a two-month stay. These included at least six views of Sandvika, a village near Christiania whose iron bridge may have reminded Monet of the Japanese bridge at his home in Giverny.</p>\n",

In these works, he simplified his palette, employed more vibrant colors, and used a thicker, broader paint application than he had earlier. Here he explored the use of complementary colors—yellow and purple, blue and orange, and red and green—in the service of chromatic intensity. The effect of these color contrasts is heightened by the pulsating pattern of brushstrokes that defines the tablecloth and creates a force field around the fruit. The painting was probably among the “violent still lifes”—to quote Van Gogh’s friend the painter <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33617\">Emile Bernard</a>—that he included in the group exhibition of young avant-garde artists that he organized at a local restaurant in November–December 1887.</p>\n",

In 1956 the Art Institute’s pioneering curator of modern art, Katherine Kuh, bought this painting from Katia Granoff's gallery in Paris. Kuh recognized a formal affinity between Monet’s late experimental painting and the public’s growing interest in large-scale, abstract works like those by Jackson Pollock, whose <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83642/greyed-rainbow\"><em>Greyed Rainbow</em></a> entered the Art Institute’s collection in 1955.</p>\n",

Shinn’s choice of subject matter and idiosyncratic perspective correspond to French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by artists like Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and also reflect his own theatrical interests and early career as an illustrator for periodicals. The Hippodrome opened in London in January 1900 as a circus and was transformed into a music hall a decade later; it is likely that Shinn attended a performance there during the venue’s first year.</p>\n",

Using a limited palette of greens and yellows with pops of lavender, Vuillard achieved a remarkable range of textures and tonalities, from the sunlit tree bark to the velvety foliage deep in the shadows. The visually dense composition vibrates in the eye and envelops the viewer. In order to enhance the painting’s decorative qualities, Vuillard mixed dry pigment with melted glue, a technique called distemper. This creates a tactile, tufted surface that differs greatly from the slick aesthetic of traditional oil painting.</p>\n",

Capturing a quintessentially Impressionist setting—a sun-dappled landscape with women and children enjoying leisure time—the artist also utilized the movement’s technique of broken brushwork and the use of brilliant colors. In the painting the children converse and frolic at the water’s edge on a windy day. There is nothing threatening about the waves or wind; indeed, Potthast’s paintings were both praised and criticized for presenting nothing other than a pleasant, innocent, and optimistic view.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s model for <em>The Laundress</em> was Nini Lopez, whom he painted regularly between 1874 and 1880 in his scenes of modern life. He made this canvas shortly after completing the illustrations for Émile Zola’s <em>L’Assommoir</em> (<em>The Drunkard</em>), a gritty novel about the downfall of a laundress in the brutal and degrading world of working-class Paris. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/105461/workers-daughters-on-the-outer-boulevard-illustration-for-emile-zola-s-l-assommoir/\"> those illustrations </a>, this painting lacks any portrayal of backbreaking labor or social oppression. Renoir chose instead to visually reference the 19th-century stereotype of laundresses being promiscuous, signaled in this and other contemporary depictions of such figures by the sleeve slipping off the shoulder. This young woman appears artfully disheveled and rosy-cheeked as she tends to the laundry in her affluent employer’s home, standing next to a basket of linens and a stove used to heat irons.</p>\n",

Van Gogh was inspired by Signac and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40810\">Georges Seurat</a>, both of whose work is on view nearby. Their technique, called divisionism, used science-based theories of color, which they applied in individual strokes to maximize luminosity. Although Van Gogh was only in Paris working among these artists for about two years, their influence can be seen here in his use of small brushstrokes of pure, brilliant color that combine to create the effect of light reflecting off the various surfaces represented in the composition.</p>\n",

The two form a pair that share a palette, subject, and vantage point. In one of his daily letters to his companion and future wife, Alice Hoschedé, dated November 24, 1885, Monet he described first <em>Boats on the Beach</em> and then <em>Departure of the Boats</em>: “In the afternoon, I worked in my room on my <em>caloges</em> [retired fishing boats covered with tarred planks and used for storage] in the rain, then I attempted to do, always through the window, a picture of the boats departing.”</p>\n<p>Monet centered each composition on the boats, combining pastel blues, pinks, purples, and greens to render wet surfaces. The brightly colored hulls of beached crafts lend relative scale to the structures in <em>Boats on the Beach</em>, and the groups of figures at the water’s edge, composed of quick, gestural strokes, register human activity in <em>Departure of the Boats</em>.</p>\n",

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>“One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all,” said Claude Monet, referring to his late masterpieces, the water landscapes that he produced at his home in Giverny between 1897 and his death in 1926. These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be\">water-lily series</a> (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted <em>Water Lilies</em>, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.</p>\n",

Although at first glance its composition seems similar to the finished canvas, its 20 or more figures have little to do with the final version. The trio at right with an elderly seated figure, for example, was completely rethought in the completed work, where they are replaced by a man in a top hat and a woman walking a monkey on a leash. This ironic combination of grand solemnity and wry humor is totally absent from the sketch’s awkwardly positioned figures.</p>\n",

Dressed in white, Deering relaxes in a cane chair with tropical foliage around him as well as views of boats and blue sky in the distance. Sargent stayed with Deering for two months in 1917 while spending considerable time painting outdoors in both oil and watercolor.</p>\n",

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>\n",

Extravagant color and brushwork were central to Sargent’s success, as was his ability to present a refined and appealing image of his sitter. In Elizabeth “Elsie” Swinton’s case, he accentuated her regal bearing and feminine dress. Sargent harmonized the realism of her face and body with bursts of impressionistic brushstrokes describing the shimmering, translucent fabric descending from her shoulder.

Here male and female students practice rendering the idealized human form. Students worked from casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, as well as from reproductions of classically inspired Renaissance objects, such as Michelangelo’s allegorical sculpture <em>Night</em> from the tomb of Giuliano de’Medici, which occupies the lower left corner of this painting. In the 19th century <em>Night</em> would not only have served as an effective demonstration of the art of antiquity but would also have represented one of the more difficult poses to illustrate. Once students mastered drawing antique and antique-inspired sculptures, they would have advanced to a class with live models.</p>\n",

Jean, later a prominent film director, recalled that the children’s nanny, Gabrielle, suggested that he keep himself occupied during the modeling session for this painting by sewing a satin coat for his toy camel.</p>\n",

Broad horizontal bands of blues and gray suggest sky, ocean, and sand, with dabs of thin pigment giving economical, yet expressive form to around a dozen figures on the windswept beach. Whistler dedicated much of his artistic practice to capturing the mood and color harmonies of marine scenes. <em>Coast Scene, Bathers</em> was painted en plein air, a practice to which the artist returned in the 1880s. It marked a distinctive shift from his studio-produced <em>Nocturnes</em> of the previous decade.</p>\n",

Here, he showcased the island’s variety of bountiful fruit trees, including a thick-trunked, violet <em>hotu</em> at left; spindly mango and coconut trees; and three short banana plants with lush, splayed leaves. In the foreground, a man uses a stick to crack a coconut and a family rests in the grass with a sleeping dog beside them. The painting’s coarsely woven canvas, made of a fibrous plant matter (jute), is visible through the paint layer. Cheaper and more readily available than traditional canvas, this support material lends the work a rugged, organic texture.</p>\n",

They had a son together in 1872 and married in 1886. Technical examination suggests that Cezanne traced this image, the second in the series, from the first portrait, which he made from life. In contrast to her masklike expression, Hortense’s hands are agitated, contorted by crisscrossing brushstrokes and the dark-blue outlines Cezanne used to sketch out the forms, which remain visible in the final work.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In February 1882, Claude Monet went to Normandy to paint, one of many such expeditions that he made in the 1880s. This was also a retreat from personal and professional pressures. His wife, Camille, had died three years earlier, and Monet had entered into a domestic arrangement with Alice Hoschedé (whom he would marry in 1892, after her husband's death). France was in the midst of a lengthy economic recession that affected Monet's sales. In addition, the artist was unenthusiastic about the upcoming seventh Impressionist exhibition—divisions within the group had become pronounced by this time—and he delegated the responsibility for his contribution to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel.Disappointed in the area around the harbor city of Dieppe, which he found too urban, Monet settled in Pourville and remained in this fishing village until mid-April. He became increasingly enamored of his surroundings, writing to Hoschedé and her children: &quot;How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!&quot; He was able to do so in June, when they joined him in Pourville.The two young women strolling in <em>Cliff Walk at Pourville</em> are probably Marthe and Blanche, the eldest Hoschedé daughters. In this work, Monet addressed the problem of inserting figures into a landscape without disrupting the unity of its painterly surface. He integrated these elements with one another through texture and color. The grass—composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes—appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women's wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea. X-radiographs show that Monet reduced the rocky outcropping at the far right to balance the proportions of sea and sky.</p>\n",

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>\n",

He painted at several easels simultaneously outside and then refined pictorial harmonies in the studio. In most of the winter views, like this one, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season.",

    "description": "<p>In George Hitchcock’s unusual presentation of the Annunciation, the virgin is depicted as a Dutch peasant girl standing in a field of lilies. Traditionally, the lily is a symbol of the angel Gabriel, and Mary’s downcast eyes and humble stance imply that she has received his divine message. Hitchcock spent much of his life in Holland, and his work synthesizes elements of several European art movements. The choice of a religious subject, the unusual composition, and his interest in the effects of sunlight and shadow reflect the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, the Symbolists, and the Impressionists on Hitchcock’s work.</p>\n",

As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist’s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist’s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting’s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte’s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat’s luminous <em>Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>, painted less than a decade later.</p>\n",
    "short_description": "Considered Caillebotte’s masterpiece, this view of a busy intersection captures both an everyday moment and all that was new in a rapidly changing Paris. The clothes are the latest fashion. The retractable umbrella was just invented. And a decades-long renovation had transformed the medieval streets of Paris into grand boulevards, like the ones seen here. It's a painting you want to walk into.",

Several utility poles frame the panorama, while the titular puff of smoke billows up from below eye level. Although Beal did not depict the source of the steam, it is probably from a passing train connecting Newburgh with the major metropolitan areas of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The artist employed a cool, silvery palette to describe the crisp atmosphere of this cold day. He applied the paint with brisk, fluid brushwork, especially in the billowing cloud, which he rendered with a tactile, white impasto.</p>\n",

The composition features two children of Beaux’s friends Helena de Kay and Richard Watson Gilder, an influential couple in New York’s cultural scene. A double portrait of the daughters engaged in a dancing lesson, the work visually evokes the transition from girlhood to adolescence.</p>\n<p>A female artist competing for portrait commissions in the male-dominated art market of the turn of the 20th century, Beaux fared exceedingly well. She was also an influential teacher, becoming the first woman to secure a faculty position at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In 1891 Arthur Wesley Dow began to engage seriously with the formal elements of Japanese art in his prints and oil paintings. In works such as <em>Boats at Rest</em>, he depicted locales around his native Ipswich, Massachusetts, using the radical cropping, elevated perspective, and flattened pictorial space characteristic of ukiyo-e (Japanese woodblock) prints. His palette of bold colors, however, is more akin to the work of French Post-Impressionist artists such as Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin. Dow’s Japanese-inspired theories of composition, which he outlined both in his publications and in the classes he taught at the Ipswich Summer School of Art and the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, were immensely influential to artists and designers working in both two and three dimensions.</p>\n",

Her early work often represented women in the modern city: nursemaids at home, women strolling in the park, shoppers, and store clerks. Strongly influenced by artist William Merritt Chase, Sparhawk-Jones’s painting constitutes a highly personal vision that drew from both Realism and Impressionism.</p>\n",

These disorienting details are complemented by the heavy, almost sculptural forms he created by using a pointed tool—possibly the end of his brush handle—to incise contours into semi-dry paint around the plate and some of the apples.</p>\n",

Brilliant pigments of orange, green, and blue electrify an otherwise tranquil scene. Through color and atmosphere rather than line or detail, Inness communicated an intensity of vision, fueled by an individual encounter with nature.</p>\n",

However, the blue rail of the balcony, visible near the top of the painting, defines the enclosed space of a private garden, and the woman’s morning dress further indicates the intimacy of her location. Cassatt signaled the modernity of her subject through the woman’s choice of reading material: she peruses a newspaper rather than a novel, demonstrating that even at home, Cassatt’s subjects are connected to the contemporary world.</p>\n",

Their paintings abound with scenes of grand boulevards and elegant, new blocks of buildings, as well as achievements of modern construction such as iron bridges, exhibition halls, and train sheds. <em>Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare</em> was an especially appropriate choice of subject for Claude Monet in the 1870s. The terminal, linking Paris and Normandy, where Monet’s technique of painting outdoors had been nurtured in the 1860s, was also the point of departure for towns and villages to the west and north of Paris frequented by the Impressionists. Monet completed eight of his twelve known paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare in time for the third Impressionist exhibition, in 1877, probably placing them in the same gallery.</p>\n<p>Monet chose to focus his attention here on the glass-and-iron train shed, where he found an appealing combination of artificial and natural effects: the rising steam of locomotives trapped within the structure, and daylight penetrating the large, glazed sections of the roof. Monet’s depictions of the station inaugurated what was to become for him an established pattern of painting a specific motif repeatedly in order to capture subtle and temporal atmospheric changes. But the series also represented his last attempt to deal with urban realities: from this point on in his career, Monet would be largely a painter of landscapes.</p>\n",

The State Street Bridge, with its characteristic curving ironwork, draws the viewer’s eye into the picture. Clark’s scene is in the tradition of the urban realism of the French Impressionists, recalling such pictures as Claude Monet’s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16571\"><em>Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare</em></a>. Like Monet, Clark sought to suggest both the ephemeral nature of fog and smoke and the atmosphere’s effect upon the forms of the city.</p>\n",

According to the Chicago collector Arthur Jerome Eddy (portrait nearby), the artist painted this seascape while boating off the coast as a crewman steadied their vessel. This could account for the unusually broad handling of paint and thick touches of pigment apparent throughout the composition, particularly in the clouds and gently cresting waves. Even toward the end of his life, Whistler demonstrated his enduring passion for the myriad relationships of color offered by the ever-changing sea.</p>\n",

In <em>Woman Bathing</em>, Cassatt combined an intimate scene from daily life with dynamic formal elements—color, composition, pattern, and shape—inspired by similar choices in work by Japanese printmakers such as Utagawa Hiroshige. Here a woman stands over a wash basin, while the mirror catches part of her reflection. The multiple patterns—the green and pink stripes in her gown, the yellow and brown leaf decorations on the blue carpet, and the similar leaves on the jug—plus the blue-green wall and the curve of the woman’s exposed back infuse this quiet setting with a slightly off-kilter perspective.</p>\n",

It was on one of his trips back to his native country that he created <em>The Powerhouse, Falls Village, Connecticut</em>. The artist frequently painted winter scenes; like many Impressionists, he was fascinated by the challenge of rendering snow and its many hues in sunlight and shade. While the winter setting was typical for Schofield, the industrial subject matter was not. In the early nineteenth century Falls Village had been a center for iron production, but by the time the artist painted these buildings, the industry was in a serious decline. The depiction of these snow-covered structures seems to suggest the renewed peace and quiet in the postindustrial town.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Vincent van Gogh so highly esteemed his bedroom painting that he made three distinct versions: the first, now in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam; the second, belonging to the Art Institute of Chicago, painted a year later on the same scale and almost identical; and a third, smaller canvas in the collection of the Musée d’Orsay, Paris, which he made as a gift for his mother and sister. Van Gogh conceived the first <em>Bedroom</em> in October 1888, a month after he moved into his “Yellow House” in Arles, France. This moment marked the first time the artist had a home of his own, and he had immediately and enthusiastically set about decorating, painting a suite of canvases to fill the walls. Completely exhausted from the effort, he spent two-and-a-half days in bed and was then inspired to create a painting of his bedroom. As he wrote to his brother Theo, “It amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat. In ﬂat tints, but coarsely brushed in full impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ﬂoor in a broken and faded red, the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet very pale lemon green, the bedspread blood-red, the dressing-table orange, the washbasin blue, the window green. I had wished to express utter repose with all these very different tones.” Although the picture symbolized relaxation and peace to the artist, to our eyes the canvas seems to teem with nervous energy, instability, and turmoil, an effect heightened by the sharply receding perspective.</p>\n",
    "short_description": "In 1888, Van Gogh moved into his own home in Arles, France. He dubbed it the “Studio of the South,” hoping that fellow artists would join him there to work. This is one of three versions he painted of his beloved Arles bedroom. While its vivid palette and dramatic perspective seem to burst with nervous vitality, Van Gogh intended the painting \"to express utter repose.\"",

    "description": "<p>Edvard Munch’s life and art — particularly his iconic work <em>The Scream</em> (1893; National Museum, Oslo) — have come to epitomize modern notions of anxiety. Yet the same year he painted his radical image, Munch was experimenting with other styles and themes. Frequent visits to Paris and Berlin between 1889 and 1893 brought the Norwegian artist into direct contact with the Impressionists and Symbolists. These travels encouraged him to adopt their bold brushwork, daring compositions, and imagery. But he nonetheless continued to incorporate the Romantic subjects of the northern European artists long familiar to him, such as a lone figure at an open window. This combination is powerfully manifested in <em>The Girl by the Window</em>, made soon after his return home to Norway.</p>\n<p>In the dead of night, a young girl in her nightgown stands in a darkened room gazing out at the city. The steep angle of the floor and the deep shadows that obliterate everything in the room, save a suggestion of a piece of furniture at the lower right, create an unsettling and enigmatic scene. Loosely applied, somber brown tones mingle with violets and blues, evoking a feeling of melancholy and anticipation. The window functions as a symbolic barrier, separating the interior from the outside world. The sense of mystery is deepened and complicated by the fact that we cannot see the expression on the girl’s face, nor do we know what she covertly observes. She in turn appears unaware that, as she gazes from behind the curtain at something unknown outside, the artist and implied viewer are watching her.</p>\n",

Cassatt saw a large exhibition of Japanese prints at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890, and produced a series of prints influenced by their aesthetics. <em>The Child’s Bath</em> is the culmination of her investigation of a flattened picture plane and decorative patterning. The intimate scene of everyday life also echoes the subject of many Japanese prints. In Cassatt’s painting, the encircling arms and gentle touch of the mother or nurse convey an overall feeling of protection and tenderness.</p>\n",

In <em>The Child’s Bath</em>, one of her masterworks, she used cropped forms, bold patterns and outlines, and a flattened perspective, all of which she derived from her study of Japanese woodblock prints.",

Specializing in landscape, Metcalf was greatly inspired by Impressionism, yet in this painting, he strayed from the pastel colors of that style and adopted an earthy palette with rich, russet tones. The unconventional look across, rather than along, Blow-Me-Down Brook limits the perspective, forcing the viewer to look down the banks of the brook to the clear, ice-covered water. Painted en plein air in the Cornish wilderness, the winter scenes of this series were some of Metcalf's most celebrated and critically praised works.</p>\n",

His marine scenes are larger than his earlier works, the size of the canvases emphasize the vastness and power of the sea. Homer alluded to the violence of water through the sharply diagonal shoreline and vigorous brushwork. The flat areas of color that he employed to represent the rugged rocks simultaneously hint at abstraction.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>“He loves everything that is joyous, brilliant, and consoling in life,” an anonymous interviewer once wrote about Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This may explain why <em>Two Sisters (On the Terrace)</em> is one of the most popular paintings in the Art Institute. Here Renoir depicted the radiance of lovely young women on a warm and beautiful day. The older girl, wearing the female boater’s blue ﬂannel, is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Technically, the painting is a tour de force: Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that—like a stage set—seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy. The sewing basket in the left foreground evokes a palette, holding the bright, pure pigments that the artist mixed, diluted, and altered to create the rest of the painting. Although the girls were not actually sisters, Renoir’s dealer showed the work with this title, along with <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> and others, at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in 1882.</p>\n",
    "short_description": "Despite the title, the young women in this painting were not actually sisters. The older girl in the center gazes absently beyond her younger companion, whose red cheeks suggest that she just dashed into the picture. These casual expressions make this “sisterly” moment feel genuine. Renoir juxtaposed the girls’ figures against a dreamy landscape, the basket of yarn evoking an artist’s palette.",

In this half-length portrait, the painter depicted Marion Deering seated with her right arm resting on a chairback, her eyes engaging the viewer. Sargent rendered her face and hand with a high degree of finish, skills he had fine-tuned in the 1870s while a student in Paris. The broader handling of paint in her dress and its lace embellishments signals Sargent’s facility with the tactile and expressive possibilities of paint. Indeed, in the mid-1880s, Sargent not only worked in portraiture, but also experimented with the themes and vocabularies of Impressionism.</p>\n",

They spent these years in Lower Norwood, outside London. In the neighboring town of Sydenham, Pissarro painted the glass-and-iron Crystal Palace, which was originally designed by Joseph Paxton in 1851 for London’s Hyde Park. Although it was immediately acclaimed for its modern architecture, only two years later the building was dismantled and reassembled in Sydenham. (It was destroyed by fire in 1936.) In this small oil painting, Pissarro relegated what was considered the world’s largest building to the left side of the canvas, as if to give equal space to the “modern-life” scene of families and carriages parading by Sydenham’s more recently constructed middle-class homes.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Consistent with the Impressionist aesthetic that Berthe Morisot fervently espoused, <em>Woman at Her Toilette</em> attempts to capture the essence of modern life in summary, understated terms. The painting also moves discreetly into the realm of female eroticism explored by Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir but seldom broached at this time by women artists. Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and ﬂower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery reﬂection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eugène the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot’s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.</p>\n",

Recognizing this, his patron Paul-Antoine Berard commissioned the artist to paint a number of portraits of his four children, in addition to likenesses of himself and his wife. Here, Renoir portrayed Lucie, Berard’s youngest and one of the artist’s favorite models, as the picture of innocence at three years old. Her small hands, positioned rather formally at her sides, lack the accessories, like toys and books, found in some other of Renoir’s portraits of children; her white dress and subtle smile invoke a serene but fleeting moment of youth.</p>\n",

Executing this work in rural England (or possibly in Nice, France), John Singer Sargent experimented with broken brushwork and a vibrant palette. The landscape composition is remarkably abstract, with the dynamic patterning of the thistles asserting the flatness of the picture plane more than any sense of depth.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 1885, the artist spent more time painting out of doors, exploring the techniques and subjects of Impressionism, inspired by a growing friendship with Claude Monet. Sargent continued painting <em>en plein air</em> throughout his life, a practice that provided needed respite from his busy schedule as an acclaimed portraitist.</p>\n",

He received his formative artistic training in Boston and headed to Paris in the early 1880s for further instruction. By the late 1880s, Vonnoh had settled in Grez-sur-Loing, a rural area outside of Paris that attracted a growing colony of artists who worked outdoors. Here, using a brilliant palette, broken brushstrokes, and unblended colors, Vonnoh captured the budding vegetation and warming sunlight of a spring day. Intense greens, peaches, and lavenders convey the dappled light and shadows of a winding road at right. The fence posts marking the edge of the yard and white linens hanging from a nearby tree highlight the scene’s domestic setting.</p>\n",

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>\n",

Incorporating the rough texture of the woodblock and limiting himself to basic shapes and a few colors, the Norwegian artist created a disturbing image of the fruitlessness of love and hope.</p>\n",

John Singer Sargent attended the performances, drawing inspiration from the “odd picturesqueness”—as a fellow artist put it—of the steep view from the upper seats. This composition shows Sargent’s perceptive use of Impressionist techniques to depict modern, urban subjects. He employed thin, abbreviated brushstrokes to capture the rich atmosphere and graphic qualities of the amphitheater’s architecture, the musicians, their sheet music and instruments, and the circus performers gathered in the foreground.</p>\n",

Bare trees, dead grasses, and the pale sky evoke a crisp spring day, freely painted with a flickering yet controlled touch. Although Garber’s painting appears impressionistic, he prized form and structure, and carefully planned his compositions. He spent months observing the land in different conditions and making studies before embarking upon the final picture in the studio.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Art, Paul Cézanne once claimed, is &quot;a harmony running parallel to nature,&quot; not an imitation of nature. In his quest for underlying structure and composition, he recognized that the artist is not bound to represent real objects in real space. Thus, <em>The Basket of Apples</em> contains one of his signature tilted tables, an impossible rectangle with no right angles. On it, a basket of apples pitches forward from a slablike base, seemingly balanced by the bottle and the tablecloth’s thick, sculptural folds. The heavy modeling, solid brushstrokes, and glowing colors give the composition a density and dynamism that a more realistic still life could never possess. This painting, one of Cézanne’s rare signed works, was part of an important exhibition urged on the artist by the Parisian art dealer Ambroise Vollard in 1895. Since Cézanne had spent the majority of his career painting in isolation in his native Provence, this was the first opportunity in nearly twenty years for the public to see the work of the artist who is now hailed as the father of modern painting.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>William Merritt Chase painted numerous versions of fish still lifes, many of which were quickly purchased by museums across the country. Because of the popularity of these works, the artist worried that he would be remembered only “as a painter of fish.” Chase’s training in the Munich style, characterized by scintillating surface texture and careful brushwork, is showcased in <em>North River Shad</em>. Brilliant white strokes form the fish’s iridescent scales, accentuating the weight and density of the voluminous creature at center. The painting is a striking departure from his better-known Impressionist renderings of city parks and other outdoor scenes.</p>\n",

This is the only painting to survive from the brief period that the couple spent in Gloton, which the novelist Émile Zola recommended to Monet as a cheap rural retreat that was easily accessible from Paris. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3-5gTaOiI&feature=youtu.be\"><em>Pentimenti</em></a> (visible traces of earlier painting beneath a layer or layers of paint) suggest that in an early stage of the painting, Camille held a bonneted child, presumably the couple’s baby, Jean.</p>\n",
    "short_description": "Monet painted this work in his late 20s when he was not yet widely known but was already using radical techniques to depict scenes from modern life, such as this one, featuring his future wife, Camille Doncieux. At the time, viewers were used to paintings that aimed to mirror reality, with a smooth traditional paint surface. To them Monet's approach seemed shockingly unfinished and illegible.",

    "description": "<p>The landscape painter George Inness once explained, “The true purpose of the painter is simply to reproduce in other minds the impression which a scene has made upon him . . . to awaken an emotion.” Inness sought, particularly in his later years, to record not so much the appearance of nature as its poetry. To achieve this, he limited his subject matter to, in his words, “rivers, streams, the rippling brook, the hillside, the sky, the clouds.” For half a century, the artist captured these moisture-laden subjects in all seasons, during all hours of the day and night. First he made small, quick sketches in the field or wood, and then, in the seclusion of his studio, he used them to create the more than one thousand oils credited to him.</p>\n<p>Inness completed <em>The Home of the Heron</em> near the end of his career, after he had finally achieved a degree of comfort and success. The painting is characteristic of his late work, with loosely rendered detail and dim objects that seem bathed in an almost incandescent glow. The picture’s blurred outlines, broad handling, and delicate, subtle tonalities, as well as the solitary presence of the heron, masterfully evoke nature’s stillness and mystery. With more than two dozen canvases by Inness, the Art Institute has one of the most comprehensive collections of the painter’s work.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In <em>The Solemn Pledge</em>, Walter Ufer portrayed three generations of Native Americans, combining a bright, saturated palette with sensitively modeled figures. The white robes worn by the boy and two of the men suggest that the group is considering pledging the boy to kiva instruction, a Pueblo tradition of education in ceremonial practices, history, and language. The painting’s subject alludes to the necessary deliberation among early 20th-century Native communities about holding fast to traditions amid governmental assimilation efforts, an issue with ongoing relevance. Ufer, who trained at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and in Munich, was an active member by 1917 of the Taos Society of Artists, a group of white artists dedicated to painting the region’s people and landscape.</p>\n",

This painting features a young woman looking at burgeoning peach blossoms, indicating both early spring and perhaps her youth. The setting, which often recurs in Homer's oeuvre, reflects nostalgia for a fading rural past. Contemporary critics referred to the artist's style at this time as independent of foreign influences, suggesting an inherently American quality. However, his stylistic decisions link this work to both French and Japanese art. Impressionism inspired Homer's use of a lighter palette, and the attention to linearity in the tree is reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy. The painting thus serves as visual evidence of the global artistic exchange of the late 19th century.</p>\n",

Harrison, Jr., gave this advice to Walter Ufer during the artist’s first summer in New Mexico in 1914, suggesting that he should not, for example, rehash romantic interpretations of Native American life. The artist took Harrison’s advice and depicted the lives and work of contemporary Native Americans, including Ufer’s favorite sitter and close friend, Jim, shown here in profile with his daughter.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>William Merritt Chase was one of the most influential painters in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. After an extended stay in Europe, which ended when he established his studio in New York City in 1878, Chase demonstrated his extraordinary versatility, painting portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and genre scenes. His vigor as an artist was equaled by his long and successful career as a teacher: his classes at the Art Students League in New York and the Shinnecock Hills Summer School on Long Island attracted many students.</p>\n<p>In the mid-1880s, Chase embarked on a group of plein-air paintings inspired by New York's parks. Influenced by the brilliant colors and unorthodox compositional formats of the French Impressionists, he often countered a broad, comparatively empty foreground with a detailed background. In this painting, which probably depicts Brooklyn’s Tompkins Park, almost half the canvas is filled by the wide, empty walkway, which, with its strong diagonal borders, carries the eye into the composition. This swift movement into space is slowed by the woman on the bench, who appears to gaze expectantly toward someone approaching along the path. To the left, colorful flowers provide a contrast to the bare walk at the right. This informal, seemingly spontaneous work, capturing the sparkle, light, and activity of a summer day, testifies to the freshness and vitality that Chase brought to the painting of such scenes.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This work, set at a circus, captures the tense moment in which a female trick rider prepares to stand up on her horse and leap through a paper hoop held by a clown. The horse gathers speed, spurred on by the whip of famous ringmaster Monsieur Loyal. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec may have based the garishly made-up rider, dressed in a tutu of gauze and sequins, on Suzanne Valadon, a former circus performer, model, and artist with whom he had a nearly three-year relationship. The rider seems to snarl at Monsieur Loyal, who glares back at her. Toulouse-Lautrec’s setting is the same circus in Montmartre depicted in Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s portrait of the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81558/acrobats-at-the-cirque-fernando-francisca-and-angelina-wartenberg\">Wartenberg sisters</a>.</p>\n",

Cobalt blue dominates the composition with striking contrasts of red and spare touches of yellow, relying on the optical effect produced by the close proximity of primary colors to enliven the composition and increase the sense of direct observation and spontaneity.</p>\n",

In <em>The Essex Canal</em>, a waterway faintly meanders from the green-hued foreground to a skim of blue along the horizon, with an expansive sky beyond. A younger generation of American artists celebrated Ryder as an important early modernist, who pushed toward abstraction and focused on the arduous process of painting itself as instrumental to one’s creative vision. Ryder’s reclusiveness only added to his intrigue and mythic status as an artist ahead of his time.</p>\n",

Seaside tourism in New England—a subject portrayed here by Carlsen and, more famously, by Winslow Homer (on view nearby)—increased in popularity during the late 19th century, offering a respite from growing industrialism.</p>\n<p>Trained in architecture in Copenhagen, Carlsen immigrated in 1872 to Chicago, shifting his focus to painting. After further study in Paris, he relocated to Boston in 1876, the year he executed this work.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>One of America’s foremost painters, Winslow Homer began his career as an illustrator during the Civil War. In the late 1860s, he turned his acute observational and technical skills toward oil painting, depicting figures bathed in sunlight out-of-doors. These early paintings, often executed in series, feature scenes of upper-class leisure pursuits—in this case, women and men competing with one another in the popular sport of croquet, which had recently been introduced to the United States from the British Isles. In <em>Croquet Scene</em>, one of five paintings Homer completed on the subject, progress on “the grand round” seems fairly advanced. The crouching male figure positions the ball belonging to the woman dressed in red. She is about to croquet (or “send up the country”) another ball, probably belonging to the woman in the left foreground, who shields her eyes against the bright afternoon sun. Notable for its bold patterning, strong contours, and brilliant light effects, the painting epitomizes the spirit of a breezy summer afternoon.</p>\n",

As is typical of Cezanne’s work, the painting is carefully considered and the composition hard won: the traces of at least three other pieces of fruit (presumably oranges) at lower left and near the vase attest to the artist’s changing opinion as he struggled to make the arrangement work. Even in the final version, there remains a tense spatial relationship between the objects, which seem to float in the picture plane rather than being anchored to the tabletop.</p>\n",

Painting his composition on site, en plein air, Sargent chose an up-close, truncated view of the sculpture, focusing not on the god of Neptune, but on the twisting, muscular bodies of other bronze figures adorning the fountain. The play of light on intricate surfaces of architecture and decoration is the composition’s principal subject.</p>\n",

A small pond behind his home offered ample artistic material, with its thick vegetation, water lilies, sun-dappled reflections, and shady nooks. A lifelong wildlife enthusiast, Benson excelled at depictions of birds. Here, he added a white heron to his composition, a species native to more southerly climes. Benson likely painted the heron from memory, having become fascinated with the stately creature<br>during his fishing trips to the Florida Keys.</p>\n",

These works show only three different views—Charing Cross Bridge and Waterloo Bridge, both painted from the Savoy Hotel; and the Houses of Parliament, painted from Saint Thomas’s Hospital. In the smoggy, industrial city, Monet challenged himself to capture effects of light seen through a dense atmospheric screen. Beyond the rectilinear skeleton of Charing Cross Bridge—reminiscent of bridges in Japanese prints, which the artist collected—rises the ghostlike silhouette of the Houses of Parliament.</p>\n",

The composition exhibits Hassam’s broken brushwork and his use of bare canvas. Bright, saturated blues and crisp whites augment the maritime tenor of the work, while the square canvas highlights its architectonic quality and harmoniously organized space.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In summer 1901 Claude Monet rented a modest house in Lavacourt, a small hamlet across the Seine from Vétheuil and not far from his property at Giverny, which he was in the process of expanding. He began 15 paintings of Vétheuil from the balcony of this rented home, all of which feature the same restricted view of the riverbank and town—punctuated by the church—and document the changes in light throughout the day. The Art Institute holds two paintings from the series, one from midday and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16579/vetheuil\">another from sunset</a>. Painted on nearly square canvases, Monet divided each composition in half, separating the town from its reflection. Rather than replicating the area’s topography or creating a convincing illusion of space, Monet emphasized the decorative over the descriptive qualities of this riverscape. His loose brushwork and subtle color transitions blur the distinctions between the scene’s various forms, dissolving the borders, for example, between the water and the land and the land and the sky. The shapes of the different buildings along the shoreline emerge through changes in the direction of brushstrokes and slight shifts in hue.</p>\n",

For years this student of Rodolphe Bresdin worked only in black and white, producing powerful and haunting charcoal drawings, lithographs, and etchings. Just as these black works, or <em>Noirs</em>, began to receive critical and public acclaim in the 1890s, Redon discovered the marvels of color through the use of pastel. His immersion in color and this new technique brought about a change in the artist’s approach to his subject matter as well. <em>Flower Clouds</em> is one of a number of pastels executed around 1905 that are dominated by spiritual overtones. Here a sailboat bears two figures, perhaps two saintly women, on a timeless journey through a fantastic, phosphorescent sea and sky. The dreamlike skiff may reflect Redon’s internal voyage, replacing the nocturnal turmoil of the earlier <em>Noirs</em> with a more hopeful vision. The luminous intensity of the pastels echoes the ardent spirituality of the theme.</p>\n",

The painting was part of Paul Gauguin’s own collection, and here he proprietarily signed his name over its white frame. Of the five or six Cézannes that he acquired while still a banker, this was the one he claimed he would never part with, “except in a case of direst necessity.” (He would eventually sell it to pay for medical treatment in Tahiti.) Although the version in this painting is nearly to scale with the original, it is more a translation than a copy, with rhythmical arabesques that are characteristic of Gauguin’s painting style rather than Cézanne’s.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Auguste Rodin’s powerfully expressive figure of Adam was originally intended to be paired with a sculpture of Eve, flanking a sculptured bronze portal commissioned by the French government for the Musée de Arts Décoratifs, Paris. For this monumental undertaking, which he entitled <em>The Gates of Hell</em>, Rodin turned to past Italian masters. Michelangelo’s <em>Creation of Adam</em> fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome (1508–12) inspired the pose of Rodin’s subject. Rodin rotated Michelangelo’s reclining Adam and transferred the frescoed figure’s gesture of receiving life from God to the sculpture’s right arm. The exaggerated turn of Adam’s left arm comes from Michelangelo’s sculpture of the dead Christ in his <em>Pietà</em> (1548–55; Museo del Duomo, Florence). Rodin chose the portal’s theme from Dante’s fourteenth-century epic poem <em>Inferno</em>; here Adam’s agonized body strikingly conveys the sufferings caused by original sin. Although the museum building was never constructed and the portal was not completed as originally conceived, Rodin explored the expressive potential of the human body as few artists before him had dared. As independent statues, Adam and Eve are among the commission’s numerous progeny. Not until 1938 was the gate cast in bronze and placed at the entrance to the grounds of the Musée Rodin, Paris.</p>\n",

However, the museum building was never constructed and the portal never completed as originally conceived.",

On each occasion he chose a similar vantage looking down on the small structure, which appears to grow out of the cliffside. The dimensions of this version are nearly identical to those of the other three canvases from the second visit. Here, Monet increased the amount of white in his paints to capture more nuanced atmospheric effects. He also experimented with techniques to animate the surface, at times scraping down or wiping away the still-soft paint to expose underlying colors. In the water, for example, breaks in the pale-gray paint reveal a bright green beneath, which the artist accentuated with additional touches of a similar green on top.</p>\n",

Toulouse-Lautrec populated <em>At the Moulin Rouge</em> with portraits of the legendary nightclub’s regulars, including himself—the diminutive figure in the center background—accompanied by his cousin, physician Gabriel Tapié de Céleyran.

Singer May Milton peers out from the right edge of the painting, her face harshly lit and acid green. At some point, the artist or his dealer cut down the canvas to remove Milton, perhaps because her strange appearance made the work hard to sell. Whatever the reason, by 1914 the cut section had been reattached to the painting.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>One of the nineteenth century’s most innovative artists, Edgar Degas often combined traditional techniques in unorthodox ways. In <em>Ballet at the Paris Opéra</em>, the artist creatively joined the monotype technique, rarely used in his time, with the fragile medium of pastel. Described as “the powder of butterfly wings,” pastel was the perfect medium to illustrate the onstage metamorphosis of spindly young dancers into visions of beauty as perfect and short-lived as butterflies. This work, executed on one of the widest monotype plates ever used by the artist, bears Degas’s characteristically cropped forms and odd vantage points, which effectively convey the immediacy of the scene. The view is from the orchestra pit, with the necks of the double basses intruding into the dancers’ zone. The central dancer is in fifth position, <em>en pointe</em>, but the random placement of the corps de ballet, with the dancers’ free-flowing hair, suggests a rehearsal rather than a performance. The Paris Opéra was the official school of the first state-supported ballet, the Académie Royale de Danse, created in 1661.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In a letter to his friend and teacher <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36211/camille-pissarro\">Camille Pissarro</a>, Paul Cézanne compared the view of the sea from L’Estaque to a playing card, with its simple shapes and colors. The landscape’s configuration and color fascinated him. This painting is one of more than a dozen such vistas created by the artist during the 1880s. Cézanne divided the canvas into four zones—architecture, water, mountain, and sky. Although these four elements are seen repeatedly in Impressionist paintings, Cézanne’s work is very different from that of his fellow artists. Whereas their primary purpose was to record the transient effects of light, Cézanne was interested in the underlying structure and composition of the views he painted. Filling the canvas with shapes defined by strong, contrasting colors and a complex grid of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, he created a highly compact, dynamic pattern of water, sky, land, and village that at once refers back to traditionally structured landscape paintings and looks forward to the innovations of Cubism. Using blocklike brushstrokes to build the space, Cézanne created a composition that seems both two- and three-dimensional. Not locked tightly in place, his forms appear to touch and shift continually, creating a sense of volume and space that strengthens the composition and brings it to life.</p>\n",

His intimate familiarity with this land, and his commitment to recording its ever-changing appearance, is apparent in <em>Centre Bridge</em>, a wintry portrayal of the hillside above the town overlooking the Delaware River. Despite the painting’s look of immediacy, Redfield carefully composed the picture to emphasize the sweeping hillside and dramatic panoramic view of the valley, using a variety of brushstrokes. The flair of his technique and local flavor of his subject matter brought Redfield enormous critical and popular acclaim as the creator of art that seemed to reflect a distinctly American character: fresh, vigorous, and rough-hewn.</p>\n",

While most artists avoided this systematic and inflexible technique for portraits, Lemmen was one of the few who successfully applied it to a psychologically intense likeness. In this depiction of his sister, Julie Fréderique Lemmen, the artist captured what his daughter described as Julie’s “biting personality” while also signaling her vulnerability through her demure pose.</p>\n",

Having served as a medical officer for the Confederate Army, Dr. William McNeill Whistler moved to the city after the Civil War and was a respected physician. Whistler modeled his brother’s face with some degree of detail, yet also employed broad brushstrokes of thinly applied paint to merely suggest the sitter’s dress, which blends into a background of flat color.</p>\n",

For several years beginning in 1855, the expatriate American artist divided his time between London and Paris; in the latter, he was exposed to the bold realism and thickly impastoed surfaces of the paintings of Gustave Courbet. The older artist’s influence shaped Whistler’s depiction of the Thames River, a subject that frequently appeared in his work after he moved to London in 1863. In this painting, he focused on the river’s industrial nature—boats and barges, laboring men, and smoking chimneys—which featured so largely in urban life.  Yet despite the realism of the subject, Whistler unified the composition with deft brushwork and a subtle palette of brown and gray that anticipates his later interest in delicate tonal harmonies.</p>\n",

He began 15 paintings of Vétheuil from the balcony of this rented home, all of which feature the same restricted view of the riverbank and town—punctuated by the church—and document the changes in light throughout the day. The Art Institute holds two paintings from the series, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14634/vetheuil\">one from midday</a> and another from sunset. Painted on nearly square canvases, Monet divided each composition in half, separating the town from its reflection. Rather than replicating the area’s topography or creating a convincing illusion of space, Monet emphasized the decorative over the descriptive qualities of this riverscape. His loose brushwork and subtle color transitions blur the distinctions between the scene’s various forms, dissolving the borders, for example, between the water and the land and the land and the sky. The shapes of the different buildings along the shoreline emerge through changes in the direction of brushstrokes and slight shifts in hue.</p>\n",

In <em>The Artist in His Studio</em>, Whistler stares out at the viewer with palette and paintbrush in hand, surrounded by works from his collection: three Japanese scrolls hang on the wall and Chinese porcelain adorns shelves on the left. He applied thin layers of paint in muted tones to evoke the flattened appearance of Japanese woodblock prints. The composition also recalls the work of the Spanish Baroque master, Diego Velázquez. Whistler harmonized Western and Eastern artistic elements, placing himself at the center of such an enterprise.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be\"><em>Stacks of Wheat</em></a> rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>\n",

In 1865 the artist traveled to Trouville, a French resort town, where he painted with Gustave Courbet and experimented with a series of increasingly simplified seascapes. The high horizon line and broad expanses of muted color in this spare composition reveal Whistler’s interest in Japanese woodblock prints. The sweeping, horizontal brushstrokes and restrained palette, limited to pale greens and soft grays, reinforce the painting’s innovative, flattened perspective.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In the summer of 1867 Claude Monet stayed with his aunt in Sainte-Adresse, an affluent suburb of the port city of Le Havre in Normandy, where the artist grew up. Monet began the painting outdoors on an overcast day but likely revised the composition in his studio in view of other related canvases, especially the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s <em>Regatta at Sainte-Adresse</em> (51.30.4). <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/9036/monet-and-chicago\">Technical analysis</a> revealed that what started as a scene of yachts and tourists at the beach ultimately became a view of sailboats and local fishermen. Monet first exhibited this painting at the Impressionist exhibition of 1876, the second of eight independent exhibitions he mounted with a group of like-minded avant-garde artists who sought to present their work outside of France’s traditional, state-sponsored Salon system.</p>\n",

After his return to Chicago, an exhibition of his work at the Art Institute attracted the attention of Julius Rosenwald—president of Sears, Roebuck and Company—and the lawyer Lessing Rosenthal. Together they gathered a group of 20 Jewish professionals to purchase <em>To the Dance</em> for the museum. The group’s support of Gaspard, a Jewish immigrant, signaled their commitment to a modernism based on cross-cultural affinities. They also may have felt a special regard for New Mexico, which was a tolerant home for Jews during the Spanish Inquisition.</p>\n",

In keeping with his art-for-art’s-sake creed, these works capture the stillness of evening while evoking the artistry of music. Unlike his earlier marine paintings, the subject of this work—an inlet along the English Channel near Southampton—is obscured by the approaching night. Large shipping vessels appear as ghostly shapes, reduced to shadowy forms by the deepening twilight, while the only points of brightness come from the subtle reflections of lights and the fragmented orb of the moon. The setting thus serves primarily as a vehicle for Whistler’s interest in the tonal harmonies of darkness.</p>\n",

In <em>Brooklyn Bridge</em> he recorded one of the greatest icons of modernity. Completed in 1883, this impressive structure was still the longest suspension bridge in the world when Ranger painted it sixteen years later. Yet instead of emphasizing its massive scale or modern construction the artist produced a fairly traditional view, integrating the bridge into the landscape. The painting displays a rich luminosity through Ranger’s method of layering applications of paint and using transparent glazes.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>The two little circus girls in this painting are Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg, who performed as acrobats in the famed Cirque Fernando in Paris. Although they were depicted in the center of a circus ring, the sisters actually posed in costume in Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s studio, enabling him to paint them in daylight. Here he portrayed them just as they have finished their act and are taking their bows. One sister turns to the crowd, acknowledging its approval, while the other faces the viewer with an armful of oranges, a rare treat that the audience has tossed in tribute. Although <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> reﬂects the artist’s enchantment with the innocence of childhood—he has enveloped the girls in a virtual halo of pinks, oranges, yellows, and whites—the partially visible, darkly clothed (mainly male) spectators allude to the less wholesome, nocturnal demimonde of the nineteenth-century circus in which these two young performers grew up. The famed Chicago collector Mrs. Potter Palmer purchased <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> in 1892 and was so enamored of the picture that she kept it with her at all times, even on her travels abroad.</p>\n",

Hassam depicted sand dunes rising from behind the beach with the promenade and its costumed bathers at a distance, reinforcing the fact that he, and the viewer, are excluded from this privileged setting. The artist’s Impressionist strategies—including the use of scintillating colors, energetic brushwork, and a light palette—capture the vibrant atmosphere of this sunny resort.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>One of seventeen canvases that Paul Gauguin completed during a brief and tumultuous visit with Vincent van Gogh in Arles, this powerful and enigmatic painting depicts the public garden directly across from Van Gogh’s residence, the “Yellow House.” Not only is the careful planning of the composition in marked contrast to the spontaneity seen in Van Gogh’s depiction of the same scene (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), but everything about the painting—its large, ﬂat areas of color; arbitrary handling of space; and enigmatic silhouettes—also exemplifies the deliberateness with which Gauguin sought pictorial harmony and symbolic content in his work. Here four women wrapped in shawls slowly stroll through the garden. The two closest to the viewer avert their gazes and curiously cover their mouths. Their somber outlines echo the two orange cones, which probably represent shrubs wrapped against the frost. The bench along the upper-left path rises steeply, defying logical perspective. Equally puzzling is the mysterious bush on the left, in which Gauguin consciously embedded forms that suggest eyes and a nose, creating the impression of a strange, watchful presence. With its aura of repressed emotion and elusive meaning, <em>Arlésiennes (Mistral)</em> explores the ambiguities, mysteries, and emotions that Gauguin believed underlie appearances.</p>\n",

In this watercolor Manet used a limited palette and a combination of techniques to depict Morisot against a blue-green background. He worked wet-into-wet for her dress, applying wet pigment onto an already wet surface before it had time to dry, which allowed the marks to bleed and blend into one another. Then Manet used a dry-brush technique to emphasize the texture of the fabric of her dress and the ribbon in her hair. Both these textures contrast with the relative flatness of the muted background, making the sitter stand out.</p>\n",

While he also painted coastal and pastoral scenes, Hassam often focused on urban areas such as his hometown of Boston, and New York City, where he lived after returning from Paris. Here the artist rendered New York with short brushstrokes that emphasize the movement and activity of everyday life on Fifth Avenue along Central Park. He incorporated vivid colors, such as the red and yellow of the woman's hat and skirt, into what would otherwise be a predominantly gray and white winter cityscape and captured the light in a natural manner, presenting a picturesque view of a modern metropolis.</p>\n",

Of the 36 paintings he showed at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in the spring of 1882, 27 were figural. Woman and Child at the Well is one of a series of works depicting peasant girls taking a break from their chores, their poses and gestures suggesting narratives that remain ambiguous. As the model for the boy in this composition, Pissarro used his fourth son, Ludovic-Rodolphe, who was four years old at the time.</p>\n",

Homer depicted the eastern landscape as a stage for human activity, rather than as a sublime paradise fraught with Christian and nationalistic associations, which was a new approach to landscape painting in the years after the Civil War.</p>\n",

A wooden barrier bisects the composition, dividing the frenzied action of the dance floor in the background from the stillness of the women waiting in the foreground. Toulouse-Lautrec used turpentine to thin his paint and applied it in loose washes, a technique known as <em>peinture à l’essence</em>. The result is a sketchy style that conveys both the immediacy of the artist’s observations and the tawdry atmosphere of his subject.</p>\n",

The artist’s genesis of this large canvas involved many preparatory studies, which fall primarily into two groups: small compositional sketches and color studies on wooden panels, and nuanced Conté crayon drawings that explore both the empty landscape and the shapes of specific figures or figural groups. In this contemplative drawing, Seurat developed the expressive contours of the seated female figure holding a parasol that would ultimately occupy the center of the finished painting.</p>\n",

He called works such as this one an “arrangement,” emphasizing formal elements rather than subject matter. The painting still serves as a portrait—it was commissioned by Chicago attorney Arthur Jerome Eddy, a collector and advocate of modern art. After seeing Whistler’s work at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in the city, Eddy traveled to the artist’s studio in Paris expressly to sit for this portrait. The two became lasting friends, and Eddy published a book on Whistler after the artist’s death in 1903.</p>\n",

MacMonnies suddenly abandoned his successful career as a sculptor to take up painting, but a lack of commercial success ultimately forced him to quit the medium in about 1906. At least nine self-portraits from this period are known. While in several of these MacMonnies holds a palette and brush, here he does not identify as an artist. Rather he portrayed himself as a gentleman of leisure, dressed and ready to attend a casual gathering. Part of a group of expatriate American artists living and working in Paris and Giverny, MacMonnies drew inspiration from the Old Masters, especially in the lighting and modeling of the figure, and from the Impressionists, whose loose brushwork and high-keyed colors likewise inform the composition.</p>\n",

He went on to work at the St. Ives artists' colony in Cornwall, England, where he adopted the Impressionist technique of painting en plein air. Symons traveled extensively in pursuit of artistic subjects, maintaining studios in a number of locations, including Colrain, Massachusetts, where he likely created <em>The Winter Sun.</em> He especially enjoyed the challenges of depicting wintry landscapes, which he largely completed outside in the elements. Symons's approach in such mature works had a forceful breadth that critics saw as particularly American in character. Paintings like <em>The Winter Sun</em> thus found great favor among American audiences and museums, which acquired many of his works.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Gifford Beal often depicted life’s exuberant side, focusing on festive places such as the circus, where many people spent their leisure time. Located near Times Square and built in 1905, the New York Hippodrome was an enormous entertainment venue. Here, Beal captured a moment during rehearsal, as a stage crew prepares for the evening show. Together the vivid colors, the figures’ exaggerated and strenuous poses, and the dramatic stage lights convey the event’s pageantry. The empty seats and trapeze bars suggest the excitement to come, when spectators and acrobats fill the theater.</p>\n<p>Beal’s portrayal of a group of circus clowns in the foreground includes one figure who appears to be in blackface, visceral evidence of the racist stereotyping that permeates American culture. Performers in blackface were regular fixtures of theater, circus, and vaudeville productions throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th century. These routines relied on comedy, derision, and distortion to normalize negative perceptions of African Americans, assert white superiority among performers and viewers, and perpetuate inequality.</p>\n",

This strong and lively work aptly captures that moment of transition, combining landscape and portraiture in a composition that speaks to friendship and painterly pursuits while also celebrating color, surface, and fleeting effects of light and movement. The couple is Wilfrid and Jane Emmet de Glehn, professional artists and Sargent’s frequent traveling companions. Although <em>The Fountain</em> has the appearance of spontaneity, Sargent was frequently interrupted by rain as he worked. He thus completed it over several days, requiring his friends to pose at length.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In 1883 Winslow Homer moved to the small coastal village of Prouts Neck, Maine, where he created a series of paintings of the sea unparalleled in American art. Long inspired by the subject, Homer had spent summers visiting New England fishing villages during the 1870s, and in 1881–82 he made a trip to a fishing community in Cullercoats, England, that fundamentally changed his work and his life. The paintings he created after 1882 focus almost exclusively on humankind’s age-old contest with nature. Here Homer depicted the heroic efforts of fishermen at their daily work, hauling in an abundant catch of herring. In a small dory, two figures loom large against the mist on the horizon, through which the sails of the mother schooners are dimly visible. While one fisherman hauls in the netted and glistening herring, the other unloads the catch. Utilizing the teamwork so necessary for survival, both strive to steady the precarious boat as it rides the incoming swells. Homer’s isolation of these two figures underscores the monumentality of their task: the elemental struggle against a sea that both nurtures and deprives.</p>\n",

In a departure from typically barren images of winter, he enjoyed depicting the beauty of the frozen terrain, believing that it was conducive to contemplation and regeneration. The dense, gradually built-up layers of paint in <em>Icebound</em> mimic the accumulation of snow on frozen ground, and the sinuous curves that define the snow and ice against the water suggest movement in an otherwise tranquil environment. Almost square in format, the painting’s harmonious composition exemplifies Twachtman’s opinion that “never is nature more lovely than when it is snowing.”</p>\n",

John Singer Sargent painted this portrait during his first extended stay in Venice as a professional artist. Rather than a formal commission, the work likely served as a souvenir of friendship and shared experiences. Its relatively small scale and the background’s thin, quick brushwork suggest that Sargent completed the canvas in a single sitting. The painting’s dark tones and limited palette are reminiscent of Spanish masters such as Diego Velázquez, whom Sargent looked to in particular during his student years in the late 1870s, and indeed throughout his career.</p>\n",

I must always paint the snow at least once a year.” Soon after, on February 13, a major blizzard hit New York City, inspiring the artist to paint <em>Love of Winter</em>. He used bright reds, yellows, and greens to intensify the winter scene and broad, slashing brushstrokes to convey movement, wind, and speed. The energetic group of skaters and onlookers, composed of people of a range of ages and social classes, reflects the diverse populations who enjoyed the public parks and the leisure activities they offered in early 20th-century New York City.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>“There she would sit, as in a throne,” a niece once recalled of George Bellows’s mother, Anna. In this painting, which evokes the Parisian interiors of such French artists as Édouard Manet, Bellows depicted his mother in a large chair in the Victorian parlor of their family home in Columbus, Ohio. This forthright presentation of a distinguished, elderly woman with a strong character, coupled with the subdued palette, also recalls the portraiture of Thomas Eakins, whom Bellows greatly admired. The painting’s power derives in part from its highly structured composition. Influenced by the artist Jay Hambidge’s theory of dynamic symmetry, Bellows constructed the portrait in an organized, geometric arrangement of proportionate rectangles and triangles.</p>\n",

However, although he maintained lasting connections to Chicago, he moved permanently to Connecticut in 1918, having commenced yearly visits to the artists' colony at Old Lyme as early as 1914. For many American Impressionists, New England towns held great appeal as a source of comfort and nostalgia. <em>Autumn</em> evokes an unchanging landscape, in which the rural traditions of American settlers—from the hand-built walls and and fences to the irregular piles of cornstalks—resonate as reminders of the nation's past at a time when the country was undergoing tremendous change.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>During the late nineteenth century, Parisian cafés were the gathering places of artists and writers and were ideal locations for observing the urban scene. Many Impressionist paintings depict the Café Nouvelle-Athènes on the rue Pigalle, where two tables were reserved for Édouard Manet and his circle—a group that included the painters Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and the writers Charles Baudelaire and Émile Zola.</p>\n<p>At first glance, this fashionably dressed young woman appears to have been captured sitting at a favorite café: the marble tabletop, beer mug, and magazine attached to a wooden bar suggest such a setting, and her heavy clothing and kid gloves indicate that she is at an outdoor table and that the weather is cool. However, the floral background is actually one of Manet's paintings and the café a re-creation in his studio.</p>\n<p><em>Woman Reading</em> is one of the most Impressionist of Manet’s images; the quick, free brushstrokes and light colors are characteristic of his technique late in his career. Painted only a few years before his death, this work admirably captures a fleeting moment, the sense of modern life that Manet and his contemporaries sought to represent.</p>\n",
    "short_description": "Édouard Manet was a pivotal figure in the development of Impressionism and modern art. Here, an elegantly dressed Parisian woman reads a magazine, a beer close at hand—a scene that would have struck contemporary viewers as fashionable and modern. While the woman appears to be outdoors, one of Manet’s paintings serves as a backdrop and other props suggest the scene was staged in Manet’s studio.",

    "description": "<p>Following a period spent producing Parisian scenes in the style of Édouard Vuillard and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard virtually reinvented his art around 1905. The artist’s new emphasis on large-scale compositions, bold forms, and brilliant colors shows his awareness of the work of his contemporaries Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, as does his focus on Arcadian landscapes, a theme he had not previously explored. Part of a series of four canvases painted for his dealers, Josse and Gaston Bernheim, between 1916 and 1920, Earthly Paradise demonstrates Bonnard’s new, daring investigations of light, color, and space. Here the artist used foliage to create a proscenium-like arch for a drama involving a brooding Adam and recumbent Eve. The contrast Bonnard established between the figures seems to follow a tradition in which the female, presented as essentially sexual, is connected with nature, while the male, essentially intellectual, is able to transcend the earthly. Heightening the image’s ambiguity is an array of animals, including birds, a monkey, rabbits, and a serpent (here reduced to a garden snake). This less-than-Edenic paradise may reflect the artist’s response to the destruction of Europe during World War I, which was still raging when he began the painting.</p>\n",

This backlit view of a shop in Venice is dark and atmospheric except for the brilliant strokes of light green and silvery white paint that describe the canes of glass as tradespeople prepare to cut them into bead-sized pieces, which will then be polished and strung into jewelry.</p>\n",

Depicted against a dark background with only his palette and brushes to indicate his profession, he looks at the viewer as if caught unawares. The unseen easel and canvas must be located immediately in front of the artist and to our left.</p>\n<p>During his brief career, which ended when he was killed in the line of duty during the Franco-Prussian War, Frédéric Bazille produced about 70 paintings, 4 of them self-portraits. He created this work while sharing an apartment-studio with Claude Monet and experimenting with new painting techniques that would be central to the Impressionist movement. It was both a practice piece (in which Bazille observed and painted his reversed image as seen in a mirror) and, given his recent decision to abandon a medical career in favor of art, a professional manifesto.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>In this interior scene of the artist’s summer residence in Maine, American Impressionist Frank Weston Benson depicted his daughter Elisabeth curled up in a rattan chair near a large fireplace. Benson is best known for his outdoor figural compositions, which often feature his wife or children in sun-filled, breezy landscapes. <em>Rainy Day</em>, in contrast, is a study of the subtler effects of interior light. The artist captured the soft, filtered light emanating from the left and embers glowing at far right. Benson was one of a number of late-19th-century artists who painted scenes of contemplative women in interiors, sometimes engaged in activities like sewing or reading, suggesting a cultural link between domesticity and femininity.</p>\n",

Glackens used vivid brushwork to describe Jeanne Mouquin’s dress, while depicting her with an intent gaze that imbues the scene with tension and mystery. By combining portraiture and everyday scenes, the artist helped usher in a mode of painting suited to the uncertainties and new social activities of modern urban life.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This painting of a rural winter landscape is resolutely un-picturesque. Its dark color palette is uninterrupted by any majestic natural elements, such as towering trees or a glittering pond. Even early in his career, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34035\">Camille Corot</a> subverted traditional landscape painting by deliberately diverging from the pastoral scenes of his mentor, Camille Corot. In this large, rectangular canvas, Pisarro applied paint heavily, often using a palette knife, in emulation of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34049/gustave-courbet\">Gustave Courbet</a>, whose work is on view nearby. Just a few years after he made this work, Pissarro adopted a more immediate approach to landscape painting, working <em>en plein air</em> (outdoors) directly from nature rather than in a studio, a technique closely associated with the Impressionists.</p>\n",
    "short_description": "Exhibited at the Salon of 1866, Pissarro made this work in deliberate opposition to the pastoral scenes of his mentor and unofficial teacher Camille Corot. Instead of using various brushes to create a beautifully crafted and refined surface, he loaded his paint on heavily in emulation of Gustave Courbet. The empty landscape, is resolutely unpicturesque and purposefully devoid of the great oaks and ancient ruins of traditional Salon landscapes.",

    "description": "<p>Of at least fifteen pastels, drawings, and paintings that Edgar Degas created on this subject during the 1880s, <em>The Millinery Shop</em> is the largest and perhaps the most ambitious. As a result of its unusual cropping and tilted perspective, it seems to capture an unedited glimpse of the interior of a small nineteenth-century millinery shop. The identity of the young woman in the painting remains unclear: she may be a shop girl or a customer. In an early version of the composition, the woman is clearly intended to be a customer; she wears a fashionable dress, though her hat—a prerequisite token of bourgeois culture—is absent. In the final painting, however, the woman appears with her mouth pursed, as if around a pin, and her hands gloved, possibly to protect the delicate fabric of the hat she holds. Degas seems to have deliberately left her role as a creator or consumer ambiguous. She is totally absorbed in her activity and, like most of the women in Degas’s paintings, seems unaware of being watched. The bonnets that are displayed on the table next to her like a still life present an analogy to the artist’s creative process: where they are unfinished, so too is the painting.</p>\n",

In a letter to poet Charles Baudelaire, he described a bullfight he attended in Madrid as “one of the finest, most curious, and most terrifying sights to be seen.” The quick sketches he made as he watched the fights informed several later canvases, including this one. Here, he underscored the tension of the moment—the crowd in the background blends together in a blur while the bullfighter and bull stand off in sharper focus.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Edgar Degas was the most subtle portrait painter in the Impressionist group. His portraits, mostly of family members and close friends, were executed primarily in the period from the late 1850s through the 1870s. During frequent visits to Florence and Naples, Degas recorded his Italian relatives with great candor. On one of his last trips to Naples, in the mid-1870s, Degas painted this double portrait of his orphaned first cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed. In this painting, Degas showed two people, separated by many years in age, who are tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Degas, having recently lost his own father and having witnessed other family misfortunes, addressed subjects such as this with awareness and sensitivity.</p>\n<p>Areas of thin paint and unresolved details suggest that the painting was never completed. But the spare treatment of the background effectively emphasizes the heads and upper portions of the figures. Their connection is expressed in the similar tilt of their heads and in the black mourning clothes they both wear. Their psychological discomfort is suggested by the contrast of the plain wall behind Lucie and the darker glass-and-wood French door behind Henri, as well as by the curved chair back against which the man sits and on which the girl leans. At once intimate and distant, casual and guarded, these two relatives, and the third relation who paints them from the other side of the paper-laden table, poignantly express the fragility and necessity of family ties.</p>\n",

Monet would later follow Boudin’s practice of painting in the open air, the technique that gave this image of a beach for middle-class vacationers its vivid spontaneity and atmospheric light. This practice would be particularly important for Monet and his contemporaries, who came to be known as the Impressionists.</p>\n<p>Eugène-Louis Boudin painted many beach scenes at the fashionable tourist spots of Trouville and Deauville in Normandy. In them we see the life of the Paris boulevards translated to the seashore. Bathing attire being still relatively rare, people wore the same clothes at the beach as they did in the city and made the same round of promenades, visits, and dinners. The huts on wheels are portable changing machines that were pulled into the water so that bathers could change without fear of exposure.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>A windblown girl looks out toward the viewer, shielding her eyes from the blinding sun with one hand while holding on to her younger sister with the other. Spanish artist Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida was enchanted with the effects of light, absorbed and reflected here in the dramatic gradient of the blue water melding into wet sand. The broad and loose brushstrokes give the work a sketch-like appearance that suits the fleeting moment.</p>\n<p>These techniques, along with his direct observation from nature, aligned Sorolla firmly with the Impressionists, with whom he exhibited in Paris. Working 30 years earlier, French Impressionist Pierre-August Renoir painted a similar theme in his <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14655/two-sisters-on-the-terrace\"><em>Two Sisters (On the Terrace)</em></a>. In contrast to Renoir’s carefully posed models, Sorolla drew his inspiration from the spontaneity of real life: his sisters appear caught in a moment of play, their positions and gestures active and awkward.</p>\n<p>Sorolla’s candid depictions of intimate, familial relationships earned him international success, particularly among American audiences, who experienced his works for the first time at an exhibition at the Hispanic Society in New York in 1909. While on vacation with his family in Valencia, Spain, that summer, Sorolla began creating works for a second American presentation, a process he believed would take five years but instead took only 18 months. <em>Two Sisters</em>  was one of 30 works he produced during that fertile period along the Spanish coast and was among the 188 pieces featured in the artist’s second US exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1911.</p>\n<p>The four-week-long show was a massive success, with around 40 of the works selling by the exhibition’s close, including <em>Two Sisters, Valencia </em>. Mrs. Elizabeth H. North purchased the painting and immediately donated it to the Art Institute in memory of her husband, William Stanley North.</p>\n",

In contrast to traditional sporting artists, who always showed races from the side with the horses in profile, Manet achieved a sense of expansive space with this thrilling vantage. The painting records the last moments of the race as the horses rush past the finish line, indicated by the pole with a circular top.</p>\n<p>Racing was not one of Manet’s preferred subjects, despite his interest in depicting the pleasures of modern life; this is one of only two surviving paintings by the artist on this theme.</p>\n",

Staccato brushstrokes of bright pigments capture the scintillating effects of the surrounding landscape. Perry was one of the first American artists to embrace Impressionism. She studied in Boston and then Paris, where in 1889 she encountered the work of Claude Monet, leading to a friendship with him and numerous summer stays near his home in Giverny. She painted this canvas there in 1895, showcasing her experimentation with form, technique, and color. Garnering an international reputation as an artist, Perry was also an early advocate of modern art in her native Boston.</p>\n",

The avant-garde set, however, celebrated its stylized form. Gauguin’s younger colleague <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40810/georges-seurat\">Georges Seurat</a>, who may have seen the sculpture at the exhibition and in Gauguin’s studio, presented similarly pared-down, columnar figures in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884\"><em> A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em></a> only a few years later.</p>\n<p>Gauguin came to painting through sculpture and preferred to work with wood, an unusual artistic medium at the time in part because of its humble nature. He sought to expand the Impressionists’ narrow definition of fine art to include objects—like this sculpture—that might be dismissed as decoration or craft.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>This monumental ceramic platter illustrates the interconnectedness of the fine and applied arts in France during the era of radical artistic innovation around 1870. It was created by Félix Bracquemond, a printmaker and designer who was deeply embedded in the Parisian avant-garde. The thickly modeled stoneware form is enameled with an arrestingly bright landscape in yellow, orange, red and green. At the center of the composition a vibrant, craggy mountain rises above an ominously dark waterfall. The boldly delineated landscape elements recall Japanese woodblock prints, which Bracquemond admired.</p>\n",
